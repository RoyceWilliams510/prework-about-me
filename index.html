      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello I'm Royce, and I am a student at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Berkeley, California</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Skateboarding, playing video games, and going on adventures with friends.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Ideally I would be a fashion designer but coding has been a passion of mine and it is much more stable.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Well right now I live in Berkeley, but I am a student in Santa Cruz so that is my formal spot of residency.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I've always considered myself as tech savy and so far I've found the field to be mildly entertaining so I'm excited to see where I can go with it.</p>
